                I graduated with a Computer Science degree from West Texas A&M
                University with a 3.9 GPA while also competing as an NCAA
                Baseball player. That experience shaped me into someone who
                thrives under pressure, both on the field and in technical
                environments.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
                Baseball taught me discipline, leadership, and sharp analytical
                thinking — all of which carry over into how I approach data
                science and software development. While I’m especially
                passionate about bringing tech into the baseball world, I’m
                well-prepared to contribute in any fast-paced, team-oriented
                setting.

              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
                I specialize in software engineering, data analysis, and
                full-stack development. I’ve developed full-stack web apps,
                machine learning models, and AR tools, blending clean design
                with real functionality. Below are my recent projects which
                include MovieVerse, a React-based movie discovery app powered by
                the TMDB API, and Protein Lens AR, an immersive learning
                platform for visualizing protein structures on Meta Quest 3.
